Student Name Panther id Section number TA name Introduction Asymmetry is an essential and conserved element of the mind, which is conceived to enhance data processing and task execution in traits central for species continued existence, such as nurturing, predator uncovering and memory (Güntürkün et al. 2000; Rogers 2000; Pascual et al. 2004; Vallortigara &amp; Rogers 2005; Rogers &amp; Vallortigara 2008).
